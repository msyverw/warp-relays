# Warp Relays

Adds Warp Relays to Minecraft

## Installation
- Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/msyverw/warp-relays/releases/latest)
- Unzip it, and put the unzipped folder in your datapacks folder
- Make sure it's the folder with [pack.mcmeta](pack.mcmeta), not just another folder
- If needed, run `/reload`
- That should do it! You know it's working if it shows up in your advancements (try pressing the `L` key)

## Config options
By running `/function warp_relay:config`, you will be presented with a variety of options you can tweak to your heart's content. These options are detailed below.
